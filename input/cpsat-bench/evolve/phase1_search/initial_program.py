Phase 1: tune CP-SAT search / subsolver knobs.

Reference: shared/cpsat_params_reference.md
  (full proto field listing — consult before adding keys; invalid names
  surface as `invalid_param` and zero the score.)

Three evolution surfaces live in this file's EVOLVE-BLOCK:
  GLOBAL_OVERRIDES  — applied to every problem
  SIZE_BUCKETS      — applied conditionally on `num_constraints`
                      (small / medium / large; first match wins).
                      The dataset spans ~7k–246k constraints; thresholds
                      below split it ~evenly. Adjust freely.
  STAGE3_OVERRIDES  — applied ONLY when stage == "stage3" AND the problem
                      is in the outlier set (Statistics/outliers_top.csv).
                      Tune knobs that help long-tail / hard outliers
                      without regressing fast/mid problems.

Targeted namespace for phase 1 (search/subsolvers):
  extra_subsolvers, ignore_subsolvers, interleave_search,
  use_feasibility_jump, use_feasibility_pump, search_branching,
  preferred_variable_order, repair_hint, diversify_lns_params.

Other params stay at BASELINE. This phase pins num_search_workers=1 so other
knobs are evaluated without multi-thread / multi-subsolver noise. Phase 3
raises the worker count to explore subsolver-mix effects.

Do NOT modify locked keys (random_seed, num_search_workers).
Invalid solver keys cause evaluator to return 0 and surface the offending key.
